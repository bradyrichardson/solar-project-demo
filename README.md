## üöÄ Overview

This demo showcases a solar energy algorithm I wrote that leverages a variety of ML technologies to analyze and visualize solar potential. The system processes 3D point cloud data, integrates with Google Maps for real-world context, and employs machine learning models to deliver accurate solar assessments using the PV library.

The result of running this algorithm is a Wh estimate per qualifying surface detected by the algorithm, along with data about the dimensions and angle of each plane in the point cloud.
